# Simon

A web-based implementation of the board game [Simon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5749/simon).

To play this memory game, simply repeat the sequence of button pushes at each level from the start to the current level.

Inspired by the 'Boss Level Challenge 2' project of the course: [The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).
